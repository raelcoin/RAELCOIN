RAELCOIN contract
RAELCOIN protocol is a mixture of RFI tokenomics with the added function of auto-liquidity generating protocol. A fork from BEE with some added benefits.
First, the dev has minted the tokens - sent the balance to mudra (https://raelcoin.com/index.php/raelcoin-lp-lock-certificate) for fair launch .
Second, utilized the mudra protocol to foster trust in the community by auto-locking liquidity for 4 years.
Simple tokenomics and elegant design and production of token information has catered to the overall success of the project.
80% community owned and driven - no rug is possible. 80% of all tokens are locked and the rest are sent to charities
#RAELCOIN join us on our journey safely to the moon!
